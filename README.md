# AI-Powered Crime Classification using Legal-BERT

This project implements an AI-powered crime classification system using **Legal-BERT embeddings** and a **Neural Network classifier**. The system automatically classifies legal case documents into predefined crime categories such as fraud, theft, assault, and others.

The project includes a **Streamlit-based web application** for real-time interaction, allowing users to upload `.txt` legal case files and instantly receive AI-generated predictions.

## Features

* Dataset preprocessing: cleans and prepares legal documents in `.txt` format
* Legal-BERT embeddings: extracts semantic features from legal text
* Neural Network classifier: predicts crime categories from embeddings
* Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
* Streamlit web app: user-friendly interface for document upload and prediction

---

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3.10+
* **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Deployment**: Streamlit
